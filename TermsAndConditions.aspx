 <p class="termsText">   “…WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  <p class="termsText">  If users abuse your website or mobile app in any way, you can terminate their account. Your “Termination”
     clause can inform users that their accounts would be terminated if they abuse your service.
If users can post content on website or mobile app (create content and share it on your platform), 
    you can remove any content they created if it infringes copyright.
Your Terms and Conditions will inform users that they can only create and/or share content they own rights to.</p>

    <p class="termsText">
Similarly, if users can register for an account and choose an username, you can inform users that they are not
     allowed to choose usernames that may infringe trademarks, i.e. usernames like Google, Facebook, and so on.

If you sell products or services, you could cancel specific orders if a product price is incorrect. Your Terms 
    and Conditions can include a clause to inform users that certain orders, at your sole discretion, can be canceled 
    if the products ordered have incorrect prices due to various errors.
